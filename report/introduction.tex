\section{Introduction}

This article presents a MIPS32-decompiler that, when passed a (semi) valid
32-bit number representing an instruction from the MIPS32 instruction-set
outputs the same instruction in various forms of representation.

In the following subsections the problem solved by the software is
presented, as is an introduction (with examples) describing the
terminology that will be used throughout this document.

The rest of the article will provide a high-level description of this
solution accompanied with a guide on how to compile and run the
software.

The appendix contains an overview of all those instructions that
the decompiler is capable of comprehending.
